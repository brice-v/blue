### Other notes

    - No semicolons needed
    - Builtin doc generator
    - builtin package manager (done the same way as something like rust with semver)
    - good size std lib like the python one (possibly with gui - maybe something simple or use like fyne)
    - can run funtions at top level
    - scripting should be easy and intuitive
    - just going to use channels and go routines
    - have a set of good math/crypto by using go's
        - as well as all the other good parts
        - archiving/compression
        - sqlite builtin or maybe some other db
        - dealing with csv builtin
        - io, files, sockets, etc...
        - os layer thats similar to posix and shell scripting
        - good datetime layer like pythons
        - argparser, flagparser, interacting with env vars
    - have a good set of collections # b trees, rb trees, queues etc...
    - `in` keyword like python allows iteration over a list/slice/range/etc...
    - maybe include some go libs to provide extra cool functionality
    - test blocks for easy testing in a file or as a seperate file
    - Importing is like it is in go but NOTE: need to fix the gopath stuff to make it trivial
        - Or im gonna make it like it is in zig/js const myns = import("path/here")
        -                                         maybe const _ = import("path") will make the names top level
        -                                 or somethign like const __main__ = ... because thats like the top level 
    - maybe make regex top level like it is in ruby/js `/[0-9]abc\w+/`
    - raw strings like in go with ` backtick
    - using go gc and their scheduler
    - will need some formatter builtin (like gofmt or black)
    - string interpolation in any string
    - some sort of debugger builtin possibly
    - maybe have shortcut in order to execute shell commands (but still in go)
    - maybe console ui package
    - builtin generics probably - this will just generate code for every type but if it can determine at compile time who calls then it can just generate the necessary
    - json decoding and other configuration parsing stuff
    - all str stuff would act like pythons
    - requests like pacakge builtin that allows you to download something easy ( this would be apart of the package manager)

    - add warnings for other common coding languages to help transistion
        - like if someone types elif or elsif or elseif - tell them to try `else if`

    - pattern matching would be cool to add (a more powerful switch where you can match on a struct/objects fields and stuff)
    - maybe optionals
    - union types would also be cool

    - var and val can both be used at top level and will then represent a global var

    - ranges would be cool like 1..13, 1.., 13..1, etc....
    - using go should be easy

    - debug printing that works like ic

    - some way to generate obj fields like js.  x.name = "John"  ==== (x = { :name, "John" })

    - question mark to propogate err (if err != nil) and using match we can handle it like rust

    - implicit return from functions as last line - only if annotated with return value? 
        - have to figure this out more
        - From Astro: A semi-colon at the end of a block, prevents the block from returning its last value
    
    - Use everything as an expression, for expression, function expression, if expression, etc...

    - Becuase of the backend in go, interfaces are satisfied my just implementing them
    - the syntax might just end up being
        interface Stringer {
            to_string() str
        }
        # Can declare types that are just objects
        type mytype obj {
            name: str,
            age: int,
        }
        # Instead of putting the values in, you put in the types
        # To implement simply satisfy the function
        fun (o: mytype) to_str() : str {           # NOTE - do we want to use a : or -> when denoting return types?
            "#{=o.name}, #{=o.age}"
        } # When we use this =variable syntax within string interpolation we can make that do debug printing similar to ic (from icecream)
        # Also this may not be a great example becuase we may not necessarily want to define a to_str method, but i digress
        - to use this it would look like

        val abc : mytype = {name: "Brice", age: 22}
        println(abc.to_str())
        ## `abc.name: "Brice", abc.age: 22`
    - More things can be explored this was just an initial foray into it
    - Similar to something in go, i might just use that go syntax explicitly
    - havent gone too much in to the deep end but it can be evaluated later becuase it still needs to work with everything

### Following Examples Led by Astro Lang

    - Want Comprehensions and high level set operations
    - Set Comp =>       (x for x in z)
    - Dict Comp =>      {x: y for x, y in zz}
    - List Comp =>      [x for x in z]
    - Lambdas =>        |x,y| => { x**2 + y**2 }
    - Regex Literal =>  /[0-9]{1,}/
    - Object Literal => var x = obj {name: "hello", age: 24}
    - Range Literal =>  1..10 (1 to 10 inclusive so this would could 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
        - 1..<10 for noninclusive (1 to 10 noninclusive would be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
    - Hex, Octal, Binary
    Literals =>         0x, 0o, 0b
    - Underscore for number separation 1_000_000
    - allow use of symbols in identifiers possibly
    - Maybe slices can be done with ranges but the python way probably makes more sense when you add in step
    - symbols/atoms? => :name = "b" 
    - Example of what astro does that i was thinking of
            // A dictionary whose keys are symbols and key-value pairs specified at initialization are optimized
            var object = { name: "James", age: 6 }
    - Sets, Dicts, and Lists can all be Mutable or Immutable thanks to var and val
    - with sets i want to support | for union, & for intersection, - for difference, ^ for symmetric difference (everything 2 sets dont have in common)
    - also with sets the comparison operators should check for subset between two sets using set1 < set2, set1 > set2, etc...
    - check if something is in a set, dict, list with `in` keyword
    - String formatting and interpolation can be done on any string
        - things like padding, spaces, etc
        - ${} seems to be the most common way but i like the way #{} looks and we use a lot of # signs
        - characters should be able to be escaped using backslash
        - maybe raw strings will use backticks like in go
    - breaking lines shouldnt matter in the language

    - and, or, not should all work alongside && || !
    - if, elif, else should work
        - elsif should return compiler warning
        - else if possibly should work due to everything being an expression but this should warn too
    
    - only one loop - for loop 
    - Proper pattern matching with struct/objects/sets etc...
        - This means things need to be able to destructure properly
    
    - Top level main should not be needed but can be used as an entry point otherwise
        a different top level statement will be used as the root node
    - Default parameters in function should be allowed
    - maybe include union types 
    - Immediately invoked functions will be possible with closures and anon funcs
    - Might need yield and next to do iterators? not sure yet
    - Try to include macros like the one in the monkey language
    - Allow casting of types and possibly types can be first class
    - Do what go does with typing to make methods work
    - Figure out how we want fields to be with visibility (should they just use the pub keyword to make them visible?)

### Some Kotlin Examples

when (x) {
    in 1..10 -> print("x is in the range")
    in validNumbers -> print("x is valid")
    !in 10..20 -> print("x is outside the range")
    else -> print("none of the above")
}
match x {
    1..10 => print("x is in the range"),
    validNumbers => print("x is valid"), # assuming validNumbers is some type of range
    not 10..20 => print("x is outside of the range"),
    {name: "brice", age: 22} => {
        # In this case the x is matched against an object with 2 named fields with values
        print("My name is #{x.name}")
        # Side note - are objects just hashmaps?
    },
    else => print("None of the above"),
    # Commas at the end of everything - improves readability 
}



# Going to use else for default case
# Want to support is_str, is_num or just `is` in general
# Use `match` instead of when and allow proper pattern matching - maybe start it off as a basic switch case thing
    # Determine the `->` syntax maybe this is best or `:` ? -- probably going to use => because its similar to Lambdas so we are reusing that symbol
