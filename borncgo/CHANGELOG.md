## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.23] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- **ARM64 NEON GEMM micro-kernel** — 4×8 register-blocked GEMM using VFMLA/VLD1/VLD1R/VST1 Plan 9 mnemonics. Runtime dispatch via `cpu.ARM64.HasASIMD`. Packed A/B panels, tile/tail/GEMV paths mirroring the AVX2 6×16 kernel ([#106](https://github.com/born-ml/born/issues/106), [#152](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/152))
- **ARM64 NEON element-wise ops** — Add/Sub/Mul/Div float32 via WORD-encoded FADD/FSUB/FMUL/FDIV (.4S vectors). Wired into existing SIMD function pointers with `simdMinLen=32` threshold ([#106](https://github.com/born-ml/born/issues/106), [#152](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/152))
- **WebGPU subgroup MatMul** — cooperative K-reduction using `subgroupAdd` across lanes. `@workgroup_size(32)`, runtime feature gate via `FeatureSubgroupOperations`. Scalar fallback on unsupported hardware ([#141](https://github.com/born-ml/born/issues/141), [#151](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/151))
- **WebGPU subgroup BatchMatMul** — same cooperative pattern with batch index via `wid.z` ([#141](https://github.com/born-ml/born/issues/141), [#151](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/151))
- **WebGPU subgroup Softmax** — three-phase cooperative: `subgroupMax` for max, `subgroupAdd` for exp-sum, per-lane normalize ([#141](https://github.com/born-ml/born/issues/141), [#151](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/151))
- **SIMD minimum slice-length threshold** — `simdMinLen=32` guard on all 47 SIMD dispatch sites. Below 32 elements, scalar loop runs ([#90](https://github.com/born-ml/born/issues/90), [#150](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/150))

### Changed

- **ADR-019: Opaque backend data** — removed all GPU knowledge from `internal/tensor/`. GPU data managed through opaque `backendData any` with `Materialize`, `BackendReleaser`, and `Materializer` interfaces. `LazyGPUData` moved to `internal/backend/webgpu/`. Zero `//go:build` tags in core tensor — WASM builds without stubs ([#126](https://github.com/born-ml/born/issues/126), [#149](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/149))

### Fixed

- **CPU hot paths** — eliminated per-element index math in reduce (innerOuter block iteration), scatter-add (pre-allocated buffer, allocs O(N)→O(1)), and batched broadcast matmul (precomputed offset table). All 8/8 tracking items complete ([#81](https://github.com/born-ml/born/issues/81), [#150](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/150))
- **WebGPU flaky tests** — eliminated all timing-dependent assertions across shared encoder, deferred staging, and encoder batch tests. Replaced with numerical correctness checks ([#149](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/149))

## [0.9.22] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- **WebGPU flaky tests** — removed timing-dependent `IsRealized()` assertions in deferred staging tests that failed under GPU driver load. Replaced with numerical correctness checks ([#146](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/146))

### Changed

- **gogpu/wgpu** v0.30.31 → v0.30.35, **gogpu/naga** v0.17.16 → v0.18.0, **gogpu/gpucontext** v0.23.0 → v0.24.0, **goffi** v0.6.2 → v0.6.3

## [0.9.21] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- **Flaky WebGPU test** — removed pre-readback `activeBatchCount() > 0` assertion in `TestSharedEncoder_FlushOnReadback` that raced under full test suite load. Post-readback assertion and numerical correctness checks remain ([#146](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/146))

### Changed

- **gogpu/wgpu** v0.30.30 → v0.30.31 (Metal checkptr fix — ObjC block callback trampolines no longer crash under `-race`)

## [0.9.20] - 2026-07-31

### Changed

- **gogpu/wgpu** v0.30.29 → v0.30.30

## [0.9.19] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- **GGUF tokenizer** — full tokenizer built from GGUF-embedded metadata arrays. Supports GPT-2 byte-level BPE and SentencePiece (greedy match). Pre-tokenization, special token handling, and byte-level encode/decode included. Public API: `tokenizer.NewGGUFTokenizer()` ([#140](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/140) by [@linkerlin](https://github.com/linkerlin))
- **GGUF array metadata** — `readArray()` now parses all 11 GGUF numeric element types via generic `readBinaryArray[T]`. Previously returned "unsupported" for arrays, blocking tokenizer vocabulary loading ([#140](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/140) by [@linkerlin](https://github.com/linkerlin))
- **CPU embedding fallback** — models whose embedding/LM-head weights exceed WebGPU's 256 MB buffer limit are automatically kept on CPU. Embedding lookup and final projection run as CPU matmul; all other layers stay on GPU ([#140](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/140) by [@linkerlin](https://github.com/linkerlin))
- **HeadDim from GGUF metadata** — `ConfigFromGGUF` reads `attention.key_length`/`attention.value_length` for models like Qwen2/MiniCPM5 where HeadDim ≠ HiddenSize/NumHeads. `KeyLength()`/`ValueLength()` helpers added to `gguf.File` ([#140](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/140) by [@linkerlin](https://github.com/linkerlin))
- **`BFloat16ToFloat32`** — IEEE 754 BF16→float32 conversion added to `internal/half`. Full test suite: normals, subnormals, signed zero, ±Inf, NaN ([#142](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/142) by [@amery](https://github.com/amery))
- **SafeTensors F16/BF16 widening** — `LoadTensor` now transparently widens F16 and BF16 tensors to float32 on load, matching GGUF loader behavior. Previously returned an error for half-precision tensors ([#142](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/142) by [@amery](https://github.com/amery))

### Fixed

- **SafeTensors reader hardening** — header offset validation rewritten: bounds-checked before allocation (prevents OOM on crafted offsets), `ReadAt` replaces `Seek+ReadFull` (concurrent-safe), negative/reversed/out-of-bounds offsets rejected. Security test suite added ([#142](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/142) by [@amery](https://github.com/amery))
- **Shape overflow guard** — `Shape.Validate()` now rejects shapes whose element count overflows `int` (e.g. `{4, 1<<62}`). Previously `NumElements()` silently wrapped to zero, enabling a crafted model file to create a tensor with a mismatched buffer ([#142](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/142) by [@amery](https://github.com/amery))

### Changed

- **gogpu/wgpu** v0.30.10 → v0.30.29, **gogpu/naga** v0.17.15 → v0.17.16, **gogpu/gpucontext** v0.21.0 → v0.23.0, **goffi** v0.5.6 → v0.6.2, **golang.org/x/sys** v0.46.0 → v0.47.0

## [0.9.18] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- **`nn.SaveTo`/`nn.LoadFrom`** — streaming Save/Load over `io.Writer`/`io.ReadSeeker` for HTTP responses, network connections, and in-memory buffers without touching disk. `nn.SaveToBytes` added as in-memory convenience. `LoadFromBytes` refactored as thin wrapper over `LoadFrom`. Serializer writer inverted onto `io.Writer`; `WriteTo` deduplication (~90 lines removed). Statement coverage 69.6% → 81.8% ([#133](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/133) by [@amery](https://github.com/amery))
- **Conv2D `StateDict`/`LoadStateDict`** — save and restore Conv2D parameters, following the same pattern as Linear. Includes `--out` flag in MNIST examples for model serialization. Example models migrated to public `nn`/`tensor` API ([#137](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/137) by [@bennibbelink](https://github.com/bennibbelink))

### Changed

- **`internal/half` package** — extracted `Float16ToFloat32` from `internal/gguf/dequant.go` into a shared leaf package. Groundwork for SafeTensors F16/BF16 and ONNX initializer support. Extended test suite with exact bit comparison, subnormals, signed zero, ±Inf, and NaN ([#136](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/136) by [@amery](https://github.com/amery))
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — documented merge strategy (squash vs merge decision tree), updated Go version to 1.26+, added Build WASM to CI table ([#135](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/135))

## [0.9.17] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **`nn.LoadFromBytes`** — load `.born` models from byte slices (`go:embed`, HTTP responses, database blobs). `BornReader` generalized from `*os.File` to `io.ReadSeeker` ([#122](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/122) by [@bennibbelink](https://github.com/bennibbelink))

### Changed

- **`nn.Save`/`nn.Load`** — public functions now forward to `internal/nn` implementation, eliminating duplicated open/close/write logic. Consistent error context wrapping ([#128](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/128) by [@amery](https://github.com/amery))

### Fixed

- **WASM build** — `GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build ./...` now compiles cleanly. Added platform stubs for `LazyGPUData` and `mmap`, removed incorrect `!wasm` constraint from pure Go tensor ops, excluded ONNX public API on WASM (matches internal package). Added WASM build check to CI ([#123](https://github.com/born-ml/born/issues/123), reported by [@bennibbelink](https://github.com/bennibbelink))
- **`nn` close errors** — all save/load functions (`Save`, `Load`, `LoadFromBytes`, `Checkpoint.Save`, `LoadCheckpoint`) now surface `Close()` errors via named returns. Previously, close errors were silently discarded ([#127](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/127) by [@amery](https://github.com/amery), [#130](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/130))

- **SIMD Sigmoid** — `1/(1+exp(-x))` composing per-vector SIMD Exp. AVX2+FMA. Up to 726× ([#119](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/119) by [@bennibbelink](https://github.com/bennibbelink))
- **SIMD SiLU** — `x*sigmoid(x)` composing per-vector SIMD Exp. AVX2+FMA. Up to 600× ([#119](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/119) by [@bennibbelink](https://github.com/bennibbelink))

- **SIMD Sum** — AVX/AVX2/AVX-512 reduction with 8 accumulators + tree reduction for float32/float64/int32/int64. Up to 16.4× speedup on large arrays. Benchmark refactor with multi-size + MB/s reporting ([#115](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/115) by [@bennibbelink](https://github.com/bennibbelink))

### Changed

Unblocks YOLOv5/v8 and vision models with upsampling layers. 57 ONNX operators total ([#111](https://github.com/born-ml/born/issues/111))
  - 15 tests covering upsample, downsample, identity, non-power-of-2 scales, multi-batch, error cases
  - ADR-018: architecture follows pool_ops pattern (direct float32 computation, no Backend changes)
- **Tolerance package** — `internal/tolerance` for approximate floating-point equality with Burn-aligned RelAbs formula, input validation, NaN/Inf handling. Replaces ad-hoc `maxDiff` checks in SIMD tests ([#107](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/107) by [@bennibbelink](https://github.com/bennibbelink))
  - Three modes: Abs, Rel, RelAbs (combined, default)

- **AVX2 pow(x,c) kernel** — Cephes exp·ln composition (~4 ULP), for ONNX Pow with scalar exponent. BirdNET sigmoid/exp hot path 6.58% → ~1% ([#104](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/104) by [@tphakala](https://github.com/tphakala))

## [0.9.9] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- **Conv im2col scratch pooling** — `sync.Pool` for colBuf and matOut buffers, eliminating per-call heap allocation and `runtime.memclr` overhead ([#101](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/101) by [@tphakala](https://github.com/tphakala))
  - Generic `poolScratch[T]` helper with grow-in-place capacity
  - Poisoned-overwrite test proves full overwrite safety
  - Zero-alloc conv forward pass on warm pool

## [0.9.8] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- **Conv im2col GEMM routing** — regular convolutions now route through the AVX2+FMA GEMM kernel via colBuf transpose ([#99](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/99) by [@tphakala](https://github.com/tphakala))
  - 16–22x faster per conv call on BirdNET shapes
  - Pooled transpose buffer (`sync.Pool`) — zero allocation overhead
  - Tiny depthwise-style calls (cOut=1, small colHeight) stay on scalar path

## [0.9.7] - 2026-06-17

- **gpucontext** v0.21.0 added as transitive dependency (via wgpu) — foundation for future gogpu/compute integration (ADR-008)

## [0.9.4] - 2026-06-15

### Changed

- **wgpu upgraded** v0.29.16 → v0.30.0 — gpucontext integration, API stabilization

## [0.9.3] - 2026-06-15

### Changed

- **wgpu upgraded** v0.29.0 → v0.29.16 — HAL wrapper stubs for all build targets (fixes `-tags=rust` compilation)
- **naga upgraded** v0.17.13 → v0.17.15
- **Dependencies**: regexp2 v1.12.0, golang.org/x/sys v0.46.0, go-webgpu/goffi v0.5.3

## [0.9.2] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **LLaMA Forward signature** — `interface{ Clear() }` → `generate.KVCache`. Model now correctly satisfies `generate.LLMModel` interface ([#68](https://github.com/born-ml/born/issues/68))
- **LLaMA Release()** — properly releases all GPU buffers for model parameters (Embed, Layers, Norm, Head). Previously missing — README example `defer model.Release()` was broken ([#68](https://github.com/born-ml/born/issues/68))

### Added

- **Compile-time LLMModel check** — `var _ generate.LLMModel = (*Model[...])(nil)` prevents future interface drift
- **6 enterprise tests** — Release safety (double-free), KV cache incremental decoding, deterministic forward, NaN/Inf check, cache Clear + layer count
- **Open Collective sponsorship** — badges in README, Sponsors/Backers section, FUNDING.yml (org-level)

## [0.9.1] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- **GPU shared encoder accumulator** ([ADR-012](docs/dev/ADR-012-gpu-encoder-batching-buffer-cache.md))
  - One CommandEncoder for N compute passes instead of N encoders
  - 128 Finish() calls → 1 per batch. GPU utilization 55% → 70-80%
  - All 15 lazy ops simplified via `addComputePassToEncoder` (-456 lines)
- **GPU input buffer cache** — `getOrCreateInputBuffer`: tensor→GPU buffer identity mapping, weight matrices uploaded once
- **`Tensor.Persist()` / `Unpersist()` API** — marks GPU tensors to survive `ReclaimMemory` between training steps (carry state, rotary embeddings, model buffers)
- **GPU training example** (`examples/gpu-training/`) — MLP on synthetic data, 77.8 steps/sec
- **LazyMode for 11 ops** — Embedding, Cast, Or, And, Not, Eq, Ne, Ge, Le, Greater, Less — eliminates last CPU readbacks in forward pass
- **TieredPool with device limits** (ADR-017) — 12 log-spaced buckets from `device.Limits()`, budget enforcement, onOOM callback
- **FlushGPU + ReclaimMemory proxy** on AutodiffBackend
- **40 new tests** — 17 shared encoder/buffer cache, 12 pool, 11 activation (Sigmoid, Tanh, SiLU, Log forward+backward)
- **GPU training regression test** — 20-step MLP OOM test

### Changed

- **SumDim/MeanDim backward** — migrated from CPU broadcastTo/unsqueezeDim to `backend.Expand`/`backend.Reshape` (ADR-009 partial, -70 lines CPU code)
- **Sigmoid/Tanh backward** — zero CPU allocation via scalar ops composition (ADR-009)
- **CrossEntropy forward** — composed via backend ops, eliminates CPU readback
- **All 42 AutodiffBackend methods** now delegate to `b.inner.XXX()` (TASK-149/150) — zero CPU bypass in forward pass
- **Pool cleanup threshold** — gpuPoolFreeThresh 5→2 for faster deallocation of unused pages
- **wgpu upgraded** v0.28.11 → v0.29.0 (triple-backend: Pure Go / Rust / WASM)

### Fixed

- **GPU buffer leak** — `TieredPool.Release()` silently ignored non-pool buffers (params, uniforms, transient inputs). 43K buffers leaked per step. Now properly calls `buffer.Release()` for non-pool buffers
- **Carry state crash** — `ReclaimMemory()` destroyed model-level persistent tensors between training steps. Fixed via Persist/Unpersist lifecycle
- **GPU batched dispatch** — auto-flush pending command buffers every 128 dispatches. Prevents Windows TDR timeout (VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST) on integrated GPUs
- **Adam.Step in NoGrad** — prevents optimizer ops from recording on autodiff tape
- **Backward stop recording** — prevents ClearTape from killing optimizer moments
- **DeferReleaseGPUBuffer** — returns to pool immediately when no encoder active
- **backend.Release** — drains liveGPU + flushes pending, zero GC warnings on shutdown
- **Pool bucket cap** at MaxBufferSize from device limits

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **CPU parallel BatchMatMul** — `sync.WaitGroup` + goroutines across batch dimension
  - Threshold: B ≤ 4 → sequential, B > 4 → parallel (`runtime.NumCPU()` workers)
  - All 4 variants: Float32, Float64, BroadcastFloat32, BroadcastFloat64
  - Fixed race condition: capped slice prevents overlapping zero-init across goroutines
- **CPU cache-tiled blocked MatMul** — 3-5x speedup for large matrices
  - i-block→k-block→j-block loop order (sequential B-matrix access)
  - Block sizes: 64 (float32, 16KB L1), 32 (float64, 8KB L1)
  - Threshold: m×n×k < 262K → naive fallback (overhead > benefit)
  - Micro-kernel extracted for compiler inlining
- **AVX2 SIMD MatMul micro-kernel** via Go 1.26 `goexperiment.simd`
  - `simd/archsimd`: LoadFloat32x8, BroadcastFloat32x8, MulAdd (FMA)
  - 4-row × 16-wide register block, zero allocations
  - Benchmark: 128×128 micro-kernel 3693 → 1058 ns/op (**3.49x**)
  - Build tag: `//go:build amd64 && goexperiment.simd` + scalar fallback
  - 13 correctness subtests
- **GPU batched dispatch** — queue lazy ops, single `queue.Submit` on Data() access
  - `finishAndQueueLazy` queues command buffers instead of immediate Submit
  - `flushCommands` submits all pending in single variadic `queue.Submit(cmdBufs...)`
  - All GPU resources (buffers + bind groups) kept alive via `lazyResources` until after Submit
  - Before: 50+ Submits per transformer forward pass (~25ms overhead). After: 1 Submit per readback
- **Embedding backward tests** — 5 tests covering 1D/2D shapes, duplicate indices, gradient flow, MulScalar chain
- **Go 1.26** — minimum Go version updated from 1.25 to 1.26 for `simd/archsimd` support

### Fixed

- **GPU batched dispatch**: bind groups and input buffers kept alive until after queue.Submit (BUG-LAZY-DEFER-RELEASE for all resource types)
- **GPU buffer copy**: `copyGPUBuffer` flushes pending commands + Poll before copy (prevents reading unsubmitted staging data)

## [0.8.3] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- **WebGPU GPU compute shaders for SelectAdd/ScatterAdd** — eliminates CPU-fallback bottleneck
  - SelectAdd: per-destination-row WGSL shader, no f32 atomics required
  - ScatterAdd: per-destination-element WGSL shader, supports up to 6D tensors
  - Results stay on GPU as lazy tensors — no GPU→CPU readback for intermediate backward results
  - Before: 27K ReadGPUBuffer calls per HRM backward step. After: 1 GPU dispatch each
  - HRM training: step time reduced from minutes to seconds
  - 13 GPU tests with CPU-GPU numeric parity verification
  - CPU fallback retained for non-lazy mode and unsupported dtypes
- `BORN_DEBUG_GPU=1` environment variable for diagnostic stderr logging of ReadGPUBuffer Poll/Map calls

### Fixed

- **WebGPU ReadGPUBuffer**: 10s timeout on `buffer.Map()` to prevent infinite hang if staging buffer is in invalid state

## [0.8.2] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- `SelectAdd` backend operation — scatter-add with 1-D indices (Embedding backward)
  - CPU: all dtypes with flat-index computation, 7 tests
  - WebGPU: CPU-data fallback (f32 atomics not in WGSL core spec)
- `ScatterAdd` backend operation — scatter-add with N-D indices (Gather backward)
  - CPU: all dtypes, validates shapes and index bounds
  - WebGPU: CPU-data fallback
- `MulScalarOp`, `AddScalarOp`, `SubScalarOp`, `DivScalarOp` autodiff operations
  - All four scalar ops now record on the gradient tape
  - Previously scalar ops were proxy-only — gradients did not flow through them

### Fixed

- **Tokenizer**: HuggingFace tokenizer now applies normalizer from tokenizer.json
  - SentencePiece models (LLaMA, Mistral) require Prepend+Replace normalizer to map spaces to `▁` (U+2581)
  - Without normalization, every token was wrong ("The" → ID 1576 instead of "▁The" → ID 450)
  - Supported normalizers: Sequence, Prepend, Replace, Lowercase, Strip
  - 13 new tests for normalizer parsing and word splitting
- **Autodiff**: Scalar ops (MulScalar, AddScalar, SubScalar, DivScalar) not recorded on gradient tape
  - Embedding weights received zero gradients when scaled by `embedScale * tokenEmbedding`
  - All models using `MulScalar` in forward pass had broken gradient flow

### Changed

- **Autodiff backward ops**: Migrated 7 ops from CPU-fallback to forward composition ([ADR-009](docs/dev/ADR-009-backward-ops-composition.md))
  - SiLU, Log, ReLU, CrossEntropy, MeanDim, Embedding, Gather backward now use backend ops only
  - Tensors never leave the GPU during backward pass (eliminates GPU→CPU readback)
  - Helper functions (`sumAll`, `sumAlongDimension`, `negateGradient`) now delegate to backend
  - Follows Burn (Rust) reference architecture: all gradients via forward ops composition
  - Net -835 lines of CPU-only backward code replaced by backend-delegated operations

## [0.8.1] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- `models/llama`: New LLaMA model package with GGUF loading and injectable attention
  - `Model[B]`, `Layer[B]`, `NewModel`, `NewModelCache` — full transformer decoder
  - Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) with RoPE (rotate-half convention)
  - SwiGLU FFN, RMSNorm, incremental KV-cache decoding
  - `WithAttentionFunc` option for runtime attention replacement (Flash Attention, etc.)
  - `Layer.DebugForward` returns attn and FFN contributions for diagnostics
  - `LoadGGUF(path, backend)` — loads Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K, Q8_0, F16, F32 weights from GGUF files
  - Implements `generate.LLMModel` interface — drop-in for `generate.TextGenerator`
  - Tested with TinyLlama-1.1B-Q8_0: Paris top-1 answer confirmed
  - Note: Q4_K_M (4-bit) requires quantized matmul for correct inference; Q8_0 (8-bit) works with full dequantization
- `loader`: Public API for model loading (`LoadGGUF`, `LoadSafeTensors`)
  - Namespace-clean: `loader.LoadGGUF(path, backend)` at module root
- `nn.SetSeed(seed)` / `nn.ResetSeed()` for reproducible weight initialization
  - Seeds both nn (Xavier, Embedding) and tensor (Randn, Rand) random sources
  - Thread-safe (sync.Mutex per package)
  - Enables deterministic model creation for experiments and testing
  - Public API: `nn.SetSeed(42)` before `nn.NewLinear(...)` guarantees identical weights
- `Clamp` element-wise tensor operation ([#61](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/61) by [@bennibbelink](https://github.com/bennibbelink))
  - Restricts values to `[min, max]` range
  - CPU: `int32`, `int64`, `float32`, `float64`
  - WebGPU: `float32`, `int32` (dedicated WGSL `clamp()` shader)
  - Autodiff backward: gradient masked by `min <= x <= max`
  - Panics on NaN bounds (float types)
  - `minBound > maxBound` → all values set to `maxBound` (matches PyTorch)
- `internal/loader`: `GGMLMapper` — maps GGUF-native (`blk.{i}.*`) tensor names to Born standard names
  - `DetectNaming` identifies HuggingFace vs GGML weight naming conventions automatically
  - `GetMapperForNaming` selects the correct mapper from a weight name sample

### Fixed

- **RoPE**: Fixed rotate-half convention (was interleaved, caused incorrect positional encoding for LLaMA)
  - Interleaved: `[-x1, x0, -x3, x2, ...]` — wrong for LLaMA/HuggingFace models
  - Rotate-half: `[-xn, x0, ..., -x2n, xn+1, ...]` — correct convention now implemented
- **GGUF Q4_K / Q5_K**: Correct scale unpacking algorithm
  - `sc[0..7]` extracted from low 6 bits of scale bytes (was reading wrong bit positions)
  - `m[0..7]` (minimum values) correctly assembled from high 2 bits + low nibble pattern
- **GGUF Float16**: Correct subnormal handling in `Float16ToFloat32`
  - Subnormals (`exp==0, mantissa!=0`) now expand correctly to `(-1)^sign * 2^-14 * mantissa/1024`
  - Previously treated subnormals as zero, silently corrupting F16 model weights
- **GGUF loader**: GGML tensor naming support (`blk.{i}.*` format)
  - Files produced by llama.cpp use GGML names; Born previously only handled HuggingFace names
  - Weight routing now correctly maps `blk.0.attn_q.weight → layers.0.attn.q.weight`
- **LLaMA loader**: Tied embeddings — `lm_head.weight` is now copied from `embedding.weight`
  when absent in the GGUF file (standard for TinyLlama, LLaMA-2, etc.)

### Changed

- **WebGPU SiLU**: SiLU activation shader connected to backend (`ops.go` now exposes `SiLU` method)
  - Previously the WGSL shader existed but was unreachable; now fully wired
- **gogpu/wgpu**: upgraded v0.26.8 → v0.27.5

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-26

### Changed

- **WebGPU backend migrated from go-webgpu to gogpu/wgpu** ([#40](https://github.com/born-ml/born/issues/40))
  - Replaced `github.com/go-webgpu/webgpu` with `github.com/gogpu/wgpu` v0.26.8 (pure Go, zero CGO)
  - **No more shared library dependency** — no `.dll`/`.so`/`.dylib` downloads needed
  - True single binary deployment: `go build` produces executable with GPU support built in
  - Vulkan primary compute backend — stable across all platforms and GPU vendors
  - WGSL shaders unchanged — full backward compatibility
  - Fixed: PipelineLayout kept alive for Vulkan SetBindGroup (was freed prematurely)
  - Fixed: lazy ops immediate submit (prevents buffer lifetime issues with DestroyQueue)
  - Fixed: lazy chain `copyGPUBuffer` immediate submit (prevents stale data in chained ops)
  - Fixed: `runtime.KeepAlive` guards prevent GC finalizer races on GPU buffers
  - Fixed: `Poll(PollWait)` in Release() ensures GPU idle before resource destruction
  - All 105 GPU tests pass, validated with real model training (HRM, 20 epochs, 0 crashes)

### Added

- `Sign` and `Abs` element-wise tensor operations — full vertical slice ([#59](https://github.com/born-ml/born/pull/59) by [@bennibbelink](https://github.com/bennibbelink))
  - `Backend.Sign` / `Backend.Abs` interface methods
  - CPU implementation with per-type helpers: `uint8`, `int32`, `int64`, `float32`, `float64`
  - Integer `Abs` uses two's-complement wraparound semantics (`abs(MinInt) == MinInt`), matching Burn / NumPy / PyTorch
  - WebGPU implementation (float32 only, with dtype guards)
  - Autodiff support: `SignOp` (zero gradient) and `AbsOp` (grad × sign)
  - Mock backend, public `Tensor.Sign()` / `Tensor.Abs()` API
  - Comprehensive tests including NaN, ±Inf, `MinInt`/`MaxInt` edge cases

## [0.7.7] - 2026-01-06

### 🔧 Public API Improvements

Refactored public API packages to use proper Go interfaces instead of type aliases where possible.

**Improvements**:
- `tensor/`: Added `Backend` interface with 40+ methods (was type alias)
- `nn/`: Added `Module` interface with full method definitions
- `onnx/`: Added `Model` interface for ONNX model operations

- `backend/cpu`, `backend/webgpu`: Added compile-time interface checks

**Technical Details**:
- Improves [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/born-ml/born) documentation by hiding internal paths
- External packages can now properly import and use the public API
- Some interfaces (`Optimizer`, `ModelReader`) remain as type aliases due to Go's type system constraints

**Fixed Issues**:
- [#25](https://github.com/born-ml/born/issues/25) — ONNX package not accessible from external packages

## [0.7.4] - 2025-12-27

### ✨ New Feature: Linear Layer Without Bias

Add `WithBias` option to `nn.NewLinear` for creating Linear layers without bias term.

**New API**:
```go
// With bias (default, backwards compatible)

## [0.7.1] - 2025-12-16

### 🔧 Code Quality Refactoring (Issue #14)

Patch release addressing cognitive complexity concerns raised by community contributor [@marcelloh](https://github.com/marcelloh). Applied [Burn framework](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn) patterns for improved code quality and maintainability.

**Pre-Slice Bounds Elimination** (`internal/backend/cpu/conv2d.go`, `maxpool2d.go`):
- Extract row slices BEFORE inner loops to eliminate bounds checks
- Hierarchical pre-slicing for nested loop structures
- Enables Go compiler to prove safety and optimize vectorization

**Stride Specialization** (`internal/backend/cpu/conv2d.go`):
- Separate fast paths for `stride=1, padding=0` case (most common)
- Specialized functions: `conv2dFloat32Stride1NoPad`, `conv2dInputBackwardFloat32Stride1NoPad`
- Enables compiler auto-vectorization for common case

**Flash Attention CPU Refactor** (`internal/nn/flash_attention.go`):
- **Complexity reduced: 111 → <30** (removed `//nolint:gocognit` directive)
- Extracted `FlashDims`, `FlashConfig` structs for configuration
- Helper functions: `flashAttentionScoreBlock`, `flashAttentionExtractValues`, `flashAttentionProcessQuery`
- Each helper under 50 AST nodes (Go compiler inlines automatically)

**Autodiff Orchestration** (`internal/autodiff/ops/`):

## [0.1.1] - 2025-11-17

### 🔥 Critical Hotfix

**BREAKING (but necessary)**: v0.1.0 had no usable public API! All packages were in `internal/` which cannot be imported by external projects. This hotfix adds proper public packages.

### ✨ Added

**Public API Packages**:
- `github.com/born-ml/born/tensor` - Type-safe tensor operations
- `github.com/born-ml/born/nn` - Neural network modules (Linear, Conv2D, MaxPool2D, etc.)
- `github.com/born-ml/born/optim` - Optimizers (SGD, Adam)
- `github.com/born-ml/born/backend/cpu` - CPU backend
- `github.com/born-ml/born/autodiff` - Automatic differentiation

**Documentation**:
- Comprehensive package documentation for pkg.go.dev
- Usage examples in each package
- API reference comments on all public types/functions

### 🔧 Changed

- Updated examples to use public API
- README updated with correct import paths

### 📦 Migration from v0.1.0

**Before (v0.1.0 - broken for external use)**:
```go
import "github.com/born-ml/born/internal/tensor"  // ❌ Cannot import!
```

**After (v0.1.1 - works!)**:
```go
import "github.com/born-ml/born/tensor"  // ✅ Public API
```

### 🧪 Testing

- All tests pass (internal tests unchanged)
- golangci-lint: 0 issues
- Public packages compile successfully
- Examples work with new imports

### 📊 Statistics

- +876 lines of public API code
- 9 new public files (doc.go + package wrappers)
- 5 public packages created
